      <p>I have 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist from 2020 to 2024, working at 
        Adani Wilmar, a leading CPG company in India. The job was no less than a wonderful 
        experience. It started with training in different functions like supply chain, sales,
        and marketing, and after that, I joined as an Executive in the IT team. 
        After completing one year as an Executive, I was promoted to Assistant Manager, 
        where I led two Data Analysts. As a Data Scientist, my work involved extracting 
        relevant data from large datasets using SQL, applying statistical models to 
        derive insights, and creating models or dashboards to present these insights effectively.
        After the start of ChatGPT, we began working on AI projects. I was part of several 
        Generative AI initiatives, which sparked my interest in understanding how AI can impact 
        businesses. This motivated me to move to the US to pursue a Masterâ€™s, so I could learn
        and apply AI concepts more deeply.
